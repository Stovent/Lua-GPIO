# Lua-GPIO
A Lua library to use the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi.

# Install
Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Stovent/Lua-GPIO`.
Go into the the folder and install the dependencies with `sudo apt install liblua5.1-0-dev`.

Compile and install the library with
```sh
make
sudo make install
```

The library will be located at `/usr/lib/libLua-GPIO.so` by default.
To change location and name, open `Makefile` and set the `installDir` and `libName` variables, respectively, to where you want to compile the library.

# How to use
Load the library with `package.loadlib("/usr/lib/libLua-GPIO.so", "luaopen_luagpio")()`. Functions will be accessible with `luagpio.<function name>()`.
The pin numbers are the BCM numbers. Check `https://pinout.xyz/` for number reference.

# Docs
`initPin(pinNumber, mode)`: Set pin to either input or output. If `mode = false`, pin will be an input. true will set the pin to output.
`setPin(pinNumber, value)`: If `value = false`, switch pin off. true will switch the pin on.
`getPin(pinNumber)`: Returns true if the pin is set, false otherwise.
